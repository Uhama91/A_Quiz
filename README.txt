# Project: Accessibility Quiz

This project is a quiz form about HTML/CSS accessibility that I've developed as part of my studies on freeCodeCamp. The site is designed to be fully accessible, respecting the principles of Web Accessibility.

## Content

The quiz contains several sections:

- Student Information: This section collects basic information about the user, such as name, email, and date of birth.
- HTML Questions: This section contains multiple-choice questions about HTML.
- CSS Questions: This section asks an open-ended question about CSS and asks the user if they are a frontend developer.

## Accessibility

The site is designed to be fully accessible. It uses ARIA roles to assist with navigation, accesskeys to facilitate access to different sections, and techniques to ensure good visibility and readability of text. Additionally, the "sr-only" attribute is used to provide additional content to screen reader users.

## Styles

The CSS file uses several advanced features to make the site attractive while respecting accessibility principles. For example, it uses a `@media` rule to make scrolling smooth for users who have not expressed a preference for reduced motion. Additionally, it uses techniques to ensure good readability of the text, such as high contrast between text and background, and the use of sans-serif fonts for easier reading.

## Usage

To use the site, simply open the `index.html` file in your web browser. Fill in the student information, then answer the questions. Click the "Send" button to submit the form.

## Future Improvements

- Addition of more questions on HTML and CSS.
- Implementation of a scoring feature to give users feedback on their answers.
- Adding other languages to make the quiz accessible to a broader audience.
